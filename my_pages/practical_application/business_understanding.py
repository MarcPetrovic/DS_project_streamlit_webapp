        The Business Understanding phase focuses on understanding the objectives and requirements of the project.
        Aside from the third general task, the three other tasks in this phase are foundational project management
        activities:
        1.	Define the business objectives: Based on a deep understanding of the business customer perspective, 
        the business success criteria can then be determined.
        2.	Assessment of the situation in the business environment: What (technical and financial) resources are 
        available, what requirements are placed on the project, what costs are associated with what returns 
        and what risks can be calculated.
        3.	Determine the objectives of data mining: In addition to defining the business objectives, the type of 
        data mining should be explained (e.g. classification) and, based on this, the success criteria of data 
        mining (e.g. accuracy) must be derived.
        4.	Produce project plan: Select technologies and tools and define detailed plans for each project phase.

        includes the task of describing the data using statistical analyses and determining attributes and their 
        characteristics. This phase also consists of a total of four tasks:
        1.	Collect initial data: Acquire the necessary data and (if necessary) load it into your analysis tool.
        2.	Describe data: Examine the data and document its surface properties like data format, number of records, 
        or field identities.
        3.	Explore data: Dig deeper into the data. Query it, visualize it, and identify relationships among the 
        data.
        4.	Verify data quality: How clean/dirty is the data? Document any quality issues.
