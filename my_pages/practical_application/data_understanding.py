        As already mentioned in the first section of the third chapter of this research project paper, data was not 
        collected independently, but secondary data was used in the empirical part of the study. The dataset used, 
        entitled *‚ÄúBank Marketing (with social/economic context)‚Äù*, is freely available to secondary researchers in 
        the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), at the following link: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing" target="_blank">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing</a>.
        The data basis of the project was collected from a Portuguese bank that used its own contact-center to do 
        directed marketing campaigns. The telephone, with a human agent as the interlocutor, was the dominant marketing 
        channel. The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, 
        corresponding to a total of 41,188 contacts. During these phone campaigns, an attractive long-term deposit 
        application, with good interest rates, was offered to the bank customers (hot flow). For each contact, a large 
        number of attributes were stored (see in detail Tables 2-5) and if there was a subscription to term deposit 
        (the target/response variable). For the whole database considered, there were 4,640 successes (11.3% success rate). 
        The data set was supplemented by five nationwide socio-economic indicators, which are published by Banco de 
        Portugal and are publicly available (see link: <a href="https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/" target="_blank">https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/</a>).

        Within the second phase of CRISP-DM, we have to understand the data, especially the structure. The data audit is 
        an essential sub-step within the second phase. Within the data audit, the available data sample is structured on 
        the basis of various properties. For example, a distinction is made between dependent and independent variables. 
        The data type of the respective characteristics of the sample is determined and the relevant value range (feature 
        domain) is also listed. A central concern of the data audit is to identify missing values and, depending on the 
        data type and relevant feature structure, to select a representative, statistical procedure to convert the missing 
        values in a targeted manner. Figure 8 shows that the available data set can basically be differentiated into four 
        feature clusters. All four feature clusters are examined in more detail in the following subsections. First, a 
        general definition of the respective characteristics of each cluster is formulated. In addition, an explorative, 
        descriptive data analysis is carried out in order to subsequently identify missing values and, against the 
        background of the industrial CRISP-DM approach, to make a pragmatic selection of procedures for converting the 
        missing values.
