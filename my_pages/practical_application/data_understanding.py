    A growing number of companies, especially financial service providers, banks and insurance companies, are 
    using customer relationship management with the sole aim of customer profiling. Recent studies clearly 
    show that there is not only a linear relationship between marketing expenditure and profit margins per 
    customer, but that a competitive advantage can be achieved through the systematic use of modern methods 
    of data pattern recognition, such as data mining and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Data mining 
    refers to the examination and analysis of large amounts of data in order to discover meaningful patterns 
    and rules. Direct marketing has developed into an important area of application for data mining, 
    particularly in connection with customer targeting, so that a taxonomy for strategic use in marketing 
    management has now become established (see Figure 3).
