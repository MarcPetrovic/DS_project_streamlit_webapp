        As already mentioned in the first section of the third chapter of this research project paper, data was not 
        collected independently, but secondary data was used in the empirical part of the study. The dataset used, 
        entitled *‚ÄúBank Marketing (with social/economic context)‚Äù*, is freely available to secondary researchers in 
        the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), at the following link: <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing" target="_blank">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing</a>.
        The data basis of the project was collected from a Portuguese bank that used its own contact-center to do 
        directed marketing campaigns. The telephone, with a human agent as the interlocutor, was the dominant marketing 
        channel. The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, 
        corresponding to a total of 41,188 contacts. During these phone campaigns, an attractive long-term deposit 
        application, with good interest rates, was offered to the bank customers (hot flow). For each contact, a large 
        number of attributes were stored (see in detail Tables 2-5) and if there was a subscription to term deposit 
        (the target/response variable). For the whole database considered, there were 4,640 successes (11.3% success rate). 
        The data set was supplemented by five nationwide socio-economic indicators, which are published by Banco de 
        Portugal and are publicly available (see link: <a href="https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/" target="_blank">https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/</a>).

        Within the second phase of CRISP-DM, the primary objective is to understand the data, especially its structure 
        and quality. Before initiating the data audit‚Äîa critical sub-step within this phase‚Äîthis study takes into account 
        the advices and documentation provided by the primary researchers who collected and curated the dataset. These 
        recommendations provide essential context for understanding variable meanings, data encoding, and known data 
        quality issues, and are therefore instrumental in designing a meaningful audit process.

        The data audit structures the available data sample based on various properties. For example, a distinction is 
        made between dependent and independent variables. The data type of each attribute is identified, and the relevant 
        value ranges (feature domains) are listed. A central concern of the audit is to detect missing values and, 
        depending on the data type and contextual relevance, to apply representative and statistically sound procedures 
        for their treatment.

        Figure 9 shows that the available dataset can be broadly categorized into four feature clusters. These clusters 
        are examined in detail in the following subsections. First, a general definition and categorization of each 
        cluster‚Äôs features is presented. Subsequently, an exploratory, descriptive data analysis is conducted, focusing 
        on data distributions, patterns, and completeness. This enables the identification of missing values and informs 
        the selection of suitable imputation or transformation methods in alignment with the industrial CRISP-DM methodology.

        The chapter concludes with a comprehensive summary of key results and derived recommendations for subsequent phases 
        of data (pre-)processing. These insights serve as a foundational basis for the Data Preparation phase that follows.

        Before conducting a structured data audit within the second phase of CRISP-DM, it is essential to consider the contextual 
        information and methodological recommendations provided by the primary researchers who originally compiled and analyzed 
        the dataset. The dataset used in this project‚Äîbank-additional-full.csv‚Äîis a refined version of the original Bank Marketing 
        dataset, extended by five nationwide socio-economic indicators. It was developed by S√©rgio Moro (ISCTE-IUL), Paulo Cortez 
        (University of Minho), and Paulo Rita (ISCTE-IUL), and has been publicly released via the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

        The primary source for contextual and methodological guidance is the publication by Moro et al. (2014), titled ‚ÄúA Data-Driven 
        Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing‚Äù, published in Decision Support Systems (Moro et al., 2014). The researchers 
        emphasize that the dataset includes 41,188 instances collected between May 2008 and November 2010, each representing a client 
        contact within a telemarketing campaign aimed at promoting a long-term deposit product.
