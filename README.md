## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the CRISP-DM methodology to a real-world business case. The main focus lies in evaluating classification models under cost-sensitive conditions and optimizing thresholds to balance operational costs and predictive performance. The results highlight how data-driven strategies can support decision-making and resource allocation in a practical context.

## Deployment
The application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed directly via the following link:
