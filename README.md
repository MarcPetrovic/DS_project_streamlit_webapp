## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the CRISP-DM methodology to a real-world business case. The main focus lies in evaluating classification models under cost-sensitive conditions and optimizing thresholds to balance operational costs and predictive performance. The results highlight how data-driven strategies can support decision-making and resource allocation in a practical context.

## Deployment
The application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed directly via the following link:
👉 [**Launch the Streamlit Web App**](https://your-streamlit-app-url.streamlit.app)

## Data Source
The analyses are based on publicly available datasets entitled “Bank Marketing (with social/economic context)”, it is freely available to secondary researchers in the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), at the following link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
